= Get involved =

Developers and translators can contribute via the [SportsPress GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ThemeBoy/SportsPress/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of SportsPress, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “SportsPress” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our sports plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our sports plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event/team/player/staff pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

= General Settings =

SportsPress comes with settings for some sports that you can apply by going to WordPress > Settings > SportsPress. By selecting a sport, presets will be applied to Events, League Tables, and Players.

= Event Settings =

Manage the results and outcomes you would like to track for each event.

Main Result is the default result that will be displayed in the admin list.

Results are the values that you want to keep track of and display on your event pages. In Association Football, for example, typical results are "1st half", "2nd half", and "Goals". For Baseball, you would have 9+ "Innings", "Hits", "Runs", and "Errors".

To add a new result, go to Settings > SportsPress > Results > Add New. Enter a name that you would like to be displayed in the column.

The "Key" is the variable name used in league table calculations and will be automatically generated when you create a new result, but you can also change this. The Order Attribute is the order that your result will be displayed among your other results.

= League Table Settings =

Manage the columns you would like to calculate and display in league tables.

Create a Title that you want to use as the column label, the Key will automatically be generated but you do have the option to change it here.

You can define an equation for a column by selecting the options from the dropdown menu. As an example, a “Wins” column should just be “W” from the dropdown. For more complex calculations, you'll need to select multiple elements to create your equations. For example, the equation for Pts in Association Football would be W x 3 + D.

"Events Played" accounts for the number of events that have an outcome selected. If an outcome has not been selected for an event, it will not be counted towards this number. For example if you played a friendly match and do not want to include the points towards your league table, do not select an outcome.

Results are tracked for each team. When you create equations, the left arrow (&larr;) represents “for” and the right arrow (&rarr;) represents “against.” For example, Goals &rarr; represents “Goals For.”

"Rounding" is the number of decimal points you want to round to at the end of a calculation.
Example: if the equation is "W &divide; Events Played" where W = 2 and Events Played = 3, setting "Rounding" to 3 will output "1.667" and rounding to 1 will output "1.7". Rounding is set to 0 by default, which returns a whole number (integer), in this case, "2".

Sort Order is for the way you want to sort your League Table. You can create and specify multiple sort orders. The first dropdown is the priority, and the second dropdown is the direction. If you want a secondary column, in the event of a tie, set another column to sort with priority "2".

As an example, in Association Football, Pts would be 1 descending, and GD would be 2 descending. This means that the leading team is the team with the most points, then the highest goal difference (GD).

Outcomes are very similar to results but you can only have one outcome per team per event. An outcome determines the ultimate result (win, draw, loss, etc.) of an event. Examples of outcomes are: W, D, L, and OT.

= Player Settings =

Manage the metrics and statistics you would like to track for each player.

Metrics are useful for variables like their height, weight, hobbies, etc. that will be displayed on player profile pages. When you create a new metric, remember to select the position(s) that the metric applies to or it will not show up in player profiles. Metrics are independent of leagues, seasons, and teams.

Statistics are for keeping track of the performance variables like goals, assists, yellow cards, and red cards. They are displayed on player profile pages, event pages, and player lists. Each player will have their own set of statistics for each event and league per season. You can choose whether to calculate the total or average of each variable by selecting from the “Calculate” dropdown menu. Be sure to select the position(s) that each statistic applies to so it shows up on the appropriate players' profile pages.
