* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of SportsPress, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "SportsPress" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our sports plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you're sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our sports plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event/team/player/staff pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add a suite of widgets to your site to display your own sports data.
2. Generate automated standings that update whenever results are published.
3. Schedule matches and display details, results, box scores, and a map to the venue.
4. Register teams and players on your site and create lineups for each team.
5. Display player profiles with configurable details and career stats.
6. Select your sport to automatically install presets and sample data.
7. Each team has a unique logo and website URL. Optionally link teams from your blog to their official websites.
8. The overview page provides a birds-eye view of your entire sports network.
9. Configure variables used throughout the plugin to fit your sport. Presets are provided for some sports, and will automatically populate these options.
10. Design your own points system using the custom drag-and-drop equation builder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which sports does this plugin support? =

= Will SportsPress work with my theme? =

Yes; SportsPress will work with any theme, but may require some styling to make it match nicely.

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =

Bugs can be reported either in our support forum or preferably on the [SportsPress GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThemeBoy/SportsPress/issues).

= Will SportsPress work with my sport? =

The plugin comes preinstalled with several different sports presets to help you get started quickly, but is also flexible enough to be customized to fit the need of any team or individual sport. Please [let us know](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sportspress) if you'd like to work with us to get your preset added the plugin.

= Can I import teams/players/staff/matches? =

Yes, CSV importers are included with the plugin. Go to Tools > Import and choose from one of the SportsPress CSV importers. Supports CSV files generated by [LeagueLobster](http://tboy.co/leaguelobster).

= What's the difference between the free and Pro plugin? =

SportsPress is a free plugin developed to give sports organizations the functionality needed to run a team, club, or league website. The plugin allows you to schedule your upcoming matches and enter the results after you've played a game. Your league tables, team and player statistics will automatically update once you've published the result to reflect the new standings.

Limitations? Don't worry, there are no limitations to the number of events, players, staff members, teams, clubs, or leagues you can add to the free plugin.

[SportsPress Pro](http://tboy.co/pro) is a premium plugin made for serious teams who are looking for additional sports functionality in their website. By upgrading to SportsPress Pro, you will be given instant access to a suite of sports modules that will appear in your dashboard.

* Tournaments: Create and display tournaments in a bracket/knockout cup format.
* Timelines: Display a visual timeline of player performance in events.
* Scoreboard: Display multiple event results in a horizontal scoreboard.
* Sponsors: Add your sponsors on your website and track each of their clicks and impressions.
* Staff Directories: Show contact information of your key personnel so people know who to get in touch with.

* League Menu: Display a global navigation bar at the top of your website for easy navigation from one team to the next.
* Twitter: Add a Twitter feed to team, player, and staff pages.
